# A Practical Excel Analysis of Gym Equipment Profitability

Project Overview:

 This project demonstrates a practical approach to data analysis using Microsoft Excel, focusing on extracting actionable insights to solve real-world business problems.  Using a fictitious gym equipment profit dataset, I performed a comprehensive analysis covering key areas such as supplier/brand/category performance, year-on-year growth trends, market share dynamics, and year-to-date (YTD) and moving annual total (MAT) profit calculations.  The project emphasizes efficiency and clarity, prioritizing insightful interpretations over complex visualizations.  My analysis reveals crucial performance indicators, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimizing profitability.
